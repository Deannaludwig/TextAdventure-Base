TextAdventure-Base
==================

An example that offers ideas on how to get started with a JavaScript-based HTML5 text adventure game.

1. The title of my game is finding my way through the forest
2. The opening of my game is a man stranded. the choices are to walk, yell, sit down, cry.

3. The setting is in a strange forest. The player will move through trees and run away from animals.

4. There will be no people. just animals and trees maybe a monster. The animals will be in the trees or on the ground (snakes). The trees will be still and the monster will be roaming. 
5. The player will be able to run, walk, sprint, hide, and find. 

6. The player could either die, or make it out of the forest
